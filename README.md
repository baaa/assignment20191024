- api will be running on http://localhost:8889
- a swagger interface is available on http://localhost:8889/docs which should help through the pain
- completely lacks input validation, has 100% trust on api user
- any unrecognised/unsupported input will explode it, this includes entering "economy" for a seat instead of "Economy"
- uses an in memory ``var`` as data storage as discussed, so functions naturally have side effects
